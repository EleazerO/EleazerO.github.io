asides defense stratergis data specfically can be made secuire with encryotion and hashing.
With encrtyption there is assymentric and symetric encryption and hashing.


***Symetic encription***

Symetric encryption uses the same key encrypt and decrypt the data


***Assymetric This encription has a public and private key.where both keys can be used to decryot but only the private key decrypts. An example would be electronic data signing and ussing the http protocol.

there are 3 forms of encryption data:

data at rest <br>
data in transist<br>
data in use.



these 3 forms of data encryption ensure attackers have no access no matter how the data is being used at the currrent time.


***Hashing***
uses a specfic algorhitm calculated to  hash the data can be compared to hased algorihm stored . THIs is easir for hackers because the aloritms can be detemrinied making it easier for them to brute force their way to match the algorohim to gain access.
