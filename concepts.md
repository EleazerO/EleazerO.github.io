## Defence stratergies##

***1. Defence in depth***

Are the various  method of  securing asssets in this order:

Physical > identity & access > perimeter > network > compute > application > data


Physical - using locks, doors etc to only auothroizd personal


identity acess - using mutlfifactor authenticatio and conditioned base access to limit and controll access to asseets/infstructure



perimieter- using ddos protection services to reduce impact before the reach core network/users or important sectors 


network using network segementation and network access controls to reduce communication between resouces



compute using access coontrol to virtul macchines or cloud by closing certain ports


applcaion-  using secuirty to ensure applicataions are secuure and have no vulnereabilities



data using secuity to encrtypt data for business and customers








***2. CIA***

***Confenditaility 
ensuting data is kept private.This is done by encryptioon and then encrypting the encrypion keys. This is a very importnt aspect of Security impmentiation into infastructure/assests.



Intergrity

ensuring data kept is up to date and coreect. This means when data is stored in a databse and is retrivd it is the same thing. This is part of security because when data is tampered or altered it can weaken it's security.Example somone saved a password in a datbase but due to encryption erroes that same poassword is rejected, here the secuitty has been comprimised.

Availibility ensuring data is avaibile to only those who need it to tightien the access to crucial information. Example only granting admin privlages to only the admin at the org to reduce orgiansatational mishasp



***3.Zero Trust Model ***


Is concept bassically saying everydevcie on  a network can't be trusted verify everthing.

The 3 principles are:
1. verify explicitly as much as possible like  including user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
2. least privaleged access.- reduce acess to as little has possible for each user to prevent catastrophies
3. Assume breach- act like you've been hacked and secure and ecnrypt everythinhng

what are we applying zero trust to? ths:

indeities
devices 
applications 
data 
infastructure
networks


basically in the 6 pillars thre should be zero trust implmentend issued for all users to minzmise negative unexpected breached
