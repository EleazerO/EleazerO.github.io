## TASK 2 -Security Analyst

Security analysts play a crucial role in keeping a company safe from cyber threats. They carefully inspect the company's computer networks to identify any weaknesses that hackers could exploit. After finding these weak spots, they provide important information and suggestions to the engineers, who then create solutions to prevent future attacks. In their job, security analysts also collaborate with different people within the company to fully understand what the company needs to stay secure and what kind of threats it might face.

## TASK 3 -  Security Engineer
Security engineers act as digital bodyguards for a company, using information about potential dangers and weaknesses gathered from other security experts. They create and set up protections to block a wide range of cyber attacks, including those targeting websites and internal networks, and they stay updated on new hacking methods.

 Their main goal is to continuously improve security measures to prevent attacks and protect the company's data from being lost or stolen.  In short a security engineer is   uses tools to secure the infrastructure of an organisation.

## TASK 4 -  Incident Response
Incident responders are like emergency firefighters for cybersecurity. When a security breach happens, they jump into action to handle the situation quickly and effectively. Their responsibilities include creating plans and protocols for organizations to follow during and after incidents. This job can be high-pressure because they need to assess and respond to attacks in real-time as they’re happening. They use metrics like MTTD (mean time to detect), MTTA (mean time to acknowledge), and MTTR (mean time to recover) to measure how fast they can find, recognize, and fix the problem. The main goal is to react swiftly and well to protect the company’s data, reputation, and finances from cyber attacks, ensuring minimal damage and disruption.

Here are their responsibilities in detail:

1. Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
2.  Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
3. Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

## Task 7  - Penetration Tester
Penetration tester's jobs are to simulate the actions of a malicious hacker to find vulnerabilities that they would find but only this time the vulnerabilities are not exploited, they reported and remediated so that it will to be late for the actual hacker inflict any damage. This is usually done with set limitations on how extreme the penetration tester can legally hack

## Task 9 - Red Teaming

Red teamers are similar to  Penetration tester however they usually have not set limitations on what they can legally break into. These involves, hacking infrastructure and even sneaking into buildings and focus more finding vulnerabilities and avoiding detection.
