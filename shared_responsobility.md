What the shared responsibility model means (plain English)

Think of cloud computing like renting a home instead of owning one.

If you own a house (on-premises), you’re responsible for everything: the building, locks, wiring, appliances, and what’s inside.

If you rent, the landlord takes care of more things—but you still lock the doors and protect your belongings.

That’s the shared responsibility model.

On-premises (no cloud)

You do everything

Building and physical security

Servers and networks

Operating systems and apps

User access and data

If something breaks or gets hacked, it’s on you.

In the cloud: responsibility is shared

As you use more managed cloud services, the cloud provider does more of the work—but never all of it.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Like renting an empty apartment

Provider handles:
The building, physical security, servers, basic networking

You handle:
Operating systems, apps, security settings, users, and data

Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Like renting a furnished apartment

Provider handles:
Servers, operating system, runtime, platform software

You handle:
Your app, how it’s configured, who can access it, and your data

Software as a Service (SaaS)

Like staying in a hotel

Provider handles:
Almost everything—app, servers, updates, security infrastructure

You still handle:
Who can log in, what data is stored or shared, and device access

What you are always responsible for (no matter what)

Even in the cloud, these never go away:

Your data (what it is, where it goes, how it’s protected)

User accounts and permissions

Devices people use to access the cloud

Security settings you choose

The cloud provider can’t protect your data if you give the wrong people access.

Shared responsibility with AI (simple version)

AI adds another layer.

Think of AI as:

The engine (provider)

The app you build or use (shared)

How people use it (you)

The provider usually:

Secures the servers and AI platform

Runs the AI models

Adds basic safety filters

You are responsible for:

What data you send to the AI

Who can use the AI

How the AI is configured

Teaching users how to use it safely

Preventing misuse (bad prompts, unsafe data, wrong outputs)

Key takeaway (in one sentence)

The cloud provider secures the technology they run—but you are always responsible for your data, your users, and how the system is used.
